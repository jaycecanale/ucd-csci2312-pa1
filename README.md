This program will prompt the user to enter the coordinates for a 3-dimensional triangle. Once the coordinates have been entered, the distanceTo() function will determine the length between Point A-B, B-C, and C-A. The computeArea() function will add all of the sides together and divide them by 2 and then they are stored in s. The function then returns the area of the triangle using Heron's Formula.
